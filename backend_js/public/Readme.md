# Cache Data and Media Files

This directory is used to store cache data and media files for the application. It serves as a temporary storage location for frequently accessed data and media resources, improving the performance and user experience of the application.

## Cache Data

Cache data refers to the temporary storage of frequently accessed data to reduce the need for repeated retrieval from the original source. In this directory, you can store cached data that is frequently used by the application. This can include data such as API responses, database query results, or any other data that needs to be accessed quickly.

## Media Files

Media files are any type of files used for visual or audio content in the application. This can include images, videos, audio files, or any other media resources. By storing these files in this directory, you can easily access and manage them within the application.

It is important to note that since this directory is used for cache data and media files, the contents may be temporary and subject to change. Therefore, it is recommended not to rely on this directory for permanent storage of important data.

Please ensure that you follow any naming conventions or guidelines specified by the project or development team when storing cache data and media files in this directory.
