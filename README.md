# Ewes Eyes: Energy Efficient UI Color Palette Generator

Welcome to Ewes Eyes, a software project designed to generate energy-efficient User Interface (UI) color palettes using stable diffusion techniques. With Ewes Eyes, users can upload an image of their UI along with a text prompt describing how they want their new UI to look. The system then generates 6-7 images, each featuring a different color palette that is more energy-efficient than the original.

## How it Works

1. **Input**: Users provide an image of their UI and a text prompt specifying their desired UI aesthetics.
2. **Processing**: Ewes Eyes utilizes stable diffusion algorithms to generate 6-7 alternative color palettes based on the provided input.
3. **Output**: The system presents the user with the generated color palette options.
4. **Selection**: Users can choose the color palette they prefer for their UI.
5. **Energy Efficiency Calculation**: The energy efficiency of each generated color palette is calculated using research-based formulas.

## Features

- **UI Image Upload**: Users can upload an image of their UI to serve as the basis for color palette generation.
- **Text Prompt**: Users can provide a text prompt describing their desired UI aesthetics, guiding the color palette generation process.
- **Multiple Options**: Ewes Eyes generates 6-7 alternative color palettes, giving users a range of choices.
- **Energy Efficiency Assessment**: The system calculates the energy efficiency of each color palette using established research formulas.
- **Palette Selection**: Users can select the color palette that best fits their preferences and energy efficiency needs.
